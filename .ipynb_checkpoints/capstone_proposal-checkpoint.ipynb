    "### Domain Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying the cellsâ€™ nuclei allows researchers to identify each individual cell in a sample, and by measuring how cells react to various treatments, the researcher can understand the underlying biological processes at work. By automating nucleus detection, research could unlock cures faster by allowing more efficient drug testing.\n",

    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to \"create a computer model that can identify a range of nuclei across varied conditions\". Since this is an object detection task, the evaluation metric that will be used is the mean average precision at different [Intersection over Union](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/11/07/intersection-over-union-iou-for-object-detection/) (IoU) thresholds. Details will be explored in more detail on the 'Evaluation Metrics' section.\n",

    "### Datasets and Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets are obtained from the [Data Web Page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018/data) of the competition. From this reference:\n",
    "\n",
    "_This dataset contains a large number of segmented nuclei images. The images were acquired under a variety of conditions and vary in the cell type, magnification, and imaging modality (brightfield vs. fluorescence). The dataset is designed to challenge an algorithm's ability to generalize across these variations._\n",
    "\n",
    "_Each image is represented by an associated ImageId. Files belonging to an image are contained in a folder with this ImageId. Within this folder are two subfolders:_\n",
    "\n",
    "* `images` contains the image file.\n",
    "* `masks` contains the segmented masks of each nucleus. This folder is only included in the training set. Each mask contains one nucleus. Masks are not allowed to overlap (no pixel belongs to two masks).\n",
    "\n",
    "_The second stage dataset will contain images from unseen experimental conditions. To deter hand labeling, it will also contain images that are ignored in scoring. The metric used to score this competition requires that your submissions are in run-length encoded format. Please see the evaluation page for details._\n",
    "\n",
    "_As with any human-annotated dataset, you may find various forms of errors in the data. You may manually correct errors you find in the training set. The dataset will not be updated/re-released unless it is determined that there are a large number of systematic errors. The masks of the stage 1 test set will be released with the release of the stage 2 test set._\n",
    "\n",
    "_File descriptions:_\n",
    "\n",
    "`/stage1_train/*` - training set images (images and annotated masks)  \n",
    "`/stage1_test/*` - stage 1 test set images (images only, you are predicting the masks)  \n",
    "`/stage2_test/*` (released later) - stage 2 test set images (images only, you are predicting the masks)  \n",
    "`stage1_sample_submission.csv` - a submission file containing the ImageIds for which you must predict during stage 1  \n",
    "`stage2_sample_submission.csv` (released later) - a submission file containing the ImageIds for which you must predict during stage 2  \n",
    "`stage1_train_labels.csv` - a file showing the run-length encoded representation of the training images. This is provided as a convenience and is redundant with the mask image files.  \n",

    "### Solution Statement\n",
    "_(approx. 1 paragraph)_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benchmark Model\n",
    "_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Design\n",
    "_(approx. 1 page)_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.\n",

    "**Before submitting your proposal, ask yourself. . .**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does the proposal you have written follow a well-organized structure similar to that of the project template?\n",
    "- Is each section (particularly **Solution Statement** and **Project Design**) written in a clear, concise and specific fashion? Are there any ambiguous terms or phrases that need clarification?\n",
    "- Would the intended audience of your project be able to understand your proposal?\n",
    "- Have you properly proofread your proposal to assure there are minimal grammatical and spelling mistakes?\n",
    "- Are all the resources used for this project correctly cited and referenced?"
